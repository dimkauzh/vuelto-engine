# Vuelto Security Policy

## Reporting security vulnerabilites

If you find a security issue with Vuelto, we please ask you that you contact us privately via [email](mailto:dima@vuelto.me) instead of making a public issue / PR, so we can fix it as soon as possible without drawing unwanted attention. You will receive a response as soon as we can, and you'll be notified and accordingly credited as we release a patch.

Thank you for helping! We want to keep Vuelto secure and contributors play a key role in that objective.
