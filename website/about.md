Vuelto is an open-source, fast, and light game engine, based on Golang, CGo, and OpenGL. It's really easy to use, yet very powerful, and it also supports cross-platform compiling. Our goal is to provide our community a solid game engine that is easy to use and powerful enough to create amazing games. All ported to work with Go's ecosystem.
