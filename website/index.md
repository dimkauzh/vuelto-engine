Vuelto is a fast and lightweight Go game engine which uses CGo and OpenGL to display your graphics. It is really easy to start with, but it can be really powerful to work with. It's cross-platform, meaning that every game you make with Vuelto will work on Windows, Linux and Mac. It's also open-source, meaning that you can see the source code and contribute to the engine. Have fun!
