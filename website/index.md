Welcome to the Vuelto website! Here you will find things like documentation, blogs, tutorials and everything about Vuelto!

## ℹ️  About
Vuelto is a fast and lightweight Go game engine which uses CGo and OpenGL to display your graphics. It is really easy to start with, but it can be really powerful to work with. It's cross-platform, meaning that every game you make with Vuelto will work on Windows, Linux and Mac. It's also open-source, meaning that you can see the source code and contribute to the engine. Have fun!

## 📦 Go package
We have a Go package published, so run this command to add it to your go.mod:
```bash
go get vuelto.me@latest
```

## 📋 Roadmap
Want to know which features are coming to Vuelto? You can find our [roadmap on the website](https://vuelto-org.github.io/vuelto/roadmap/v1).

## 🎉 Discord server
We have a [discord server at this link](https://discord.gg/gZqdRXbbqg). It's a fun server mainly created for vuelto, but you can talk about whatever you want. So come join us!

## 🤝 Contributing
We are fully open to contributions, but I will check and test your code before merging it into the dev branch. All your code thats accepted will only be merged into the dev branch, and will be later released with the next release.

## 🔐 License
Vuelto is licensed under the [VL-Cv1.1 Licence](LICENSE.md). Any PRs that primarily focus on changing the license won't be accepted.
